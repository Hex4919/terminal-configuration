# terminal-configuration
A Place to Store my Terminal Configuration

At some point I might have the time to write a blog article about this...
## Setup
Shell: fish  
Prompt: starship  
Multiplexer: tmux  

## Use this Setup
Where to move files in order to use this configuration. Mostly a reminder for myself...
```
$ mv tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
$ mv starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
$ mv ./fish ~/.config
```

## ToDo
Things I want to improve
* Have a closer look at fish configuration
* Change something starship.toml
